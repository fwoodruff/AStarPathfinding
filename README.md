# AStarPathfinding
A Star Pathfinding with shortcut search

I learned about and implemented the A*-pathfinding algorithm.
I then came up with a function that finds detours that improve the A*-path when the heuristic is not admissible.

This project is not ambitious but instead showcases maturity in my understanding of algorithms, data structures and modern C++ style.
